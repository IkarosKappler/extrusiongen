email to info@dildo-generator.com.


Note that since version 0.3.4 the gallery has social media integration (using
a Two-Click plugin).

Note that since version 0.3.0 the app is capable to store dildo designs in a
databse.

Note that since version 0.2.37 the app tries to store designs in cookies. Before
no data had been saved anywhere. I switched to a new privacy policy.

	 + shapeTwist: percentage of rotations (still experimental)

   'base type' settings was still recognized which broke the mesh). 
 - Fixed the createHumanReadableTimestamp() function: added leading zeros.

   and user_id); if id is missing, a regular INSERT is made.
 
 - Note: Merchants should have a look at the new function in the 
         merchant_tools.js file. I also added the %id% placeholder
	 to the configured storage URL.

   _DILDO_CONFIG.IMAGES.PREVIEW_BACKGROUND

[2014-06-17] v0.2.27
 - Since this version there is a code snippet example explaining how to
   to store dildo design on a server (in a database). This is just an example
   and not active. The site dildo-generator.com does _not_ store any design
   data.

[2013-09-12] 
   Implemented a better bezier curve splitting.

[2013-09-11]

TODO
----
[2014-10-27]
 - Check if $_DILDO_SETTINGS["gallery_settings"]["DILDO_UPDATE_ALLOWED"] = TRUE
   works (in the inc/config.inc.php file).

[2013-10-15]
 - The 'Merge Meshes' STL option should be included into the settings 
   import/export.

[2013-09-24]
 - The bezier scaling by bounding-box works so far but there is a
   boundary required to avoid the path to be scale to width=0 or	
   height=0.
 - [DONE 2013-10-15]
   The mm-measurements are not yet applied to the STL models.
 - The bezier-Settings file should also store scaling and
   draw offset.
   When loading a file these settings should be restored so the bezier
   path is at the same position.

[2013-09-16]
 - Add an enhanced polygon triangulation algorithm for the case
   the mesh is split; the cut is not yet properly filled. Vertically
   non-convex bezier curves cause errors in the mesh.
 - [DONE 2013-09-18]
   Bug: the second last bezier point cannot be deleted.

[2013-09-13]
 - Fix Safari incompatibility.
 - [DONE 2013-10-02]
   Add CSS message box for errors and warnings.
 - [DONE 2013-10-04]
   Add process bar.
 - Add a compatibility check with error message.

[2013-09-12]
 - Add dummy console for older browsers

[2013-09-11]
 - [DONE 2013-09-11] 
   Zip file import
 - [DONE 2013-09-24]
   Add ruler/measurements
 - [DONE 2013-09-18]
   Implement split mesh
 - Implement second inner perpendicular hull (for wax)
 - [DONE 2013-09-12] 
   Implement a better bezier curve splitting
 - Add an undo-function to the bezier editor
 - [DONE 2013-09-24]
   Shape scaling by moving bounding box nodes
