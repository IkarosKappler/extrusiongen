/**
 * This is a simple abstract shape factory class.
 *
 * The idea is to pass a shape (the default shape is a circle) to the generator
 * which 'moves' the shape along a path â€” applying some other modifications.
 *
 * To use different shapes it is useful to declare this abstract factory class.
 * Subclasses should inherit its functions.
